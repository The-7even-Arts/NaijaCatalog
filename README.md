This code creates a Django model called `BookCatalogue` with the following fields:

- Title
- Author
- Subject
- ISBN
- Date Published
- Publisher
- Publisher Location
- Series
- Call Number
- Library/Institution

Each field is a `models.CharField` with a specified maximum length, except for `date_published`, which is a `models.DateField`. The `__str__` method returns a string representation of the object, which is the title of the book in this case.


Using the online catalog will help you to locate:
circulating books with information on a subject, person, or an idea
circulating books on related topics
circulating books with retrospective information
reference books that will refine your topic
reference books that provide themes, timelines, and subjects
